This program is meant to assist in choosing and/or locating movies in Tobias Andersen's Letterboxd list/game, "Random Movie Roulette." Follow [this link](https://letterboxd.com/tobiasandersen2/list/random-movie-roulette/) to view the list and to read his original descripton of it.

## How to Work the Helper

1. Click the "run" button at the top of the page
2. When prompted for input, key in your choice (1, 2, or 3) and then Enter
3. Copy/paste the generated URL
4. Once at the correct page, type Ctrl+F (Windows) or Cmd+F (Mac) and then type in the movie's number to locate it on the page.

### And That's It

I hope this tool is helpful to you. Any feedback would be appreciated and can (ideally) be left as a comment on [my Letterboxd clone of this list](https://letterboxd.com/zachary_white/list/random-movie-roulette-with-number-locator/).
